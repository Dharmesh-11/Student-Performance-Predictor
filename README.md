## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Performance Predictor** is a Machine Learning application designed to predict a student's academic outcome (Pass/Fail or Grade Range) using various academic and behavioral factors.  

🎯 **Goal:** To assist teachers, parents, and institutions in identifying at-risk students early and providing timely interventions to improve their performance.  

---

## 🛠 Features
✅ Predicts student performance (Pass/Fail/Grade).  
✅ Clean and interactive **Streamlit/Tkinter UI**.  
✅ Supports visualization of data (charts & graphs).  
✅ Provides model accuracy and evaluation metrics.  
✅ Can be deployed locally or on the cloud.
